I’m currently working on the Quantify Jiu-jitsu platform, where I aim to use my expertise in cloud technology to improve the study experience for practitioners. The platform focuses on enhancing study notes management and allows users to share their notes with friends, creating a collaborative learning environment.\nI’m excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to both the cloud computing industry and the BJJ community.\n","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Kuanting Wu","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":" Logo Title Description References Quantify Jiujitsu Active An interactive platform designed to enhance study notes management and allows users to share their notes with friends, creating a collaborative learning environment. sitegithub ","date":"13 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Kuanting Wu","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
