I graduated from National Cheng Kung University with a bachelor's degree in physics. Along the way, I took several computer science classes, which sparked my interest in cloud engineering. Since then, I’ve earned AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate certifications as I work toward building a strong foundation in the field.  

Outside of tech, I’m passionate about Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I’m currently working on the Quantify Jiu-jitsu platform, where I aim to use my expertise in cloud technology to improve the study experience for practitioners. The platform focuses on enhancing study notes management and allows users to share their notes with friends, creating a collaborative learning environment.

I’m excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to both the cloud computing industry and the BJJ community.
